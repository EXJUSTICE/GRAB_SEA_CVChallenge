## Optimizing a MobileNet classifier on the constrained Stanford Cars Dataset

This is a MobileNetV2 based submission for the Grab Ai For SEA Challenge 2- rapid visual recognition of the Stanford Car Dataset.
The criteria for performance were as follows


* Accuracy
* Precision
* Recall
* Speed/performance (derived from discussions with judges during opening ceremony)

As such, a MobileNetV2 based classifier was chosen due to its lightweight footprint, low number of parameters, and capability for near real-time mobile-based recognition.

## Dataset
## Approach
The Stanford car dataset has been extensively studied on various networks, including MobileNetV2 [Source] (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.02987.pdf?fbclid=IwAR26yjKltuRmb9q9U8Dj3F-oGDXWVrp1UW_ipq3_ZanYmFWglijwbatqO2g)
